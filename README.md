# Wireless Infrastructure Network Management Software
 This Software provides Controling, Monitoring and analyzing a Micro-grid(power grid) Network.

 this project is underdeveloped and it will be finish by Oct. 15th.
 
 following features have been developed so far:
 
 1. login and authentication panel
 
 2. Network Configuration page (setting power grids' name and key codes)
 
 3. Zigbee configuration page (config new Zigbee modules and add them to the network)
 
 4. Graph page (plotting power grids's data like, Voltage, Power, etc.)
 
 5. Data table (exhibit data of micro-grid network online)
 
 6. saving section (save all data coming from network nodes in .csv format)
 
 7. Micro-Grid Diagram
